   - Go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Add to `.env.local`
4. **Set Up Database**: Run `DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
5. **Enable Email Auth**:
   - Go to Authentication → Providers
   - Enable Email provider
   - Configure email templates (optional)
6. **Test Sign In**: Click "Sign In" in navigation

## 📸 Real Disease Detection Integration

### Current State:
- ✅ PlantVillage disease classifications (38+ diseases)
- ✅ TensorFlow.js image preprocessing
- ✅ Intelligent mock predictions
- ⏳ Ready for real model integration

### To Add Real Model (Choose One):

#### **Option A: Roboflow (Easiest)**

1. Sign up: https://roboflow.com
2. Use Plant Disease dataset or upload your own
3. Train model (1-click)
4. Get API endpoint
5. Update `lib/modelHandler.ts`:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(
  `https://detect.roboflow.com/plant-disease/1?api_key=${ROBOFLOW_KEY}`,
  { method: 'POST', body: base64Image }
);
const predictions = await response.json();
```

#### **Option B: Plant.id API**

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.plant.id/v2/health_assessment', {
  headers: { 'Api-Key': PLANT_ID_KEY },
  body: JSON.stringify({ images: [base64Image] })
});
```

#### **Option C: Custom Model**

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for full instructions on:
- Training with PlantVillage dataset
- Converting to TensorFlow.js
- Hosting and loading
