# Authentication Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **AuthProvider Error Fixed**
**Error:** `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider`

**Solution:** Wrapped the entire application with `AuthProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`

```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <Navigation />
  <main className="min-h-screen">
    {children}
  </main>
  <Toaster />
</AuthProvider>
```

### 2. ✅ **Removed Google Sign-In**
**Changes:**
- Removed Google OAuth button from `AuthModal.tsx`
- Removed `signInWithGoogle()` function from `lib/auth-context.tsx`
- Simplified authentication to email/password only

### 3. ✅ **Email Verification Banner**
**Added:** Prominent notification banner after sign-up

**Features:**
- ✅ Beautiful green banner with icons
- ✅ Shows the email address the verification was sent to
- ✅ Clear instructions to check inbox
- ✅ Reminder to check spam folder
- ✅ Dismissible with X button
- ✅ Auto-shows after successful sign-up
- ✅ Form clears after sign-up

**Banner appears with:**
- Mail icon in green circle
- "Account Created!" heading with checkmark
- "Please check your email inbox to verify your account before signing in"
- Shows user's email address
- "Don't see it? Check your spam folder" tip

### 4. ✅ **Better Error Handling**
**Sign-in error handling:**
- Detects "Email not confirmed" error
- Shows clear message: "Please verify your email before signing in. Check your inbox for the verification link."

```

## Supabase Configuration Needed

For email verification to work, configure Supabase:

1. **Go to:** Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates
2. **Verify:** "Confirm signup" template is enabled
3. **Optional:** Customize the email template

### Default Confirmation URL:
```
{{ .ConfirmationURL }}
```

This automatically redirects to your app after verification.
