## 3. 🔧 Fixing Supabase Errors

### Error You Saw:
```
placeholder.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup:1 
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

### Root Cause:
Environment variables not loading in production. The app was using:
```typescript
const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co';
```

When env var is missing, it defaults to `placeholder.supabase.co` which doesn't exist!

### Solution:
Added environment variables to Vercel for all environments:
- ✅ Production
- ✅ Preview  
- ✅ Development

## 4. 🔧 Fixing Local Database Error

### Error You Saw:
```
Could not find the table 'public.detection_results' in the schema cache
```

### Root Cause:
Database tables don't exist yet! You need to run the schema.

### Solution:

**Go to Supabase:**
1. Visit: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
6. Click **Run** button

**This will create:**
- ✅ `user_profiles` table
- ✅ `detection_results` table
- ✅ `community_posts` table
- ✅ `community_replies` table
- ✅ `chat_messages` table
- ✅ `optimization_plans` table
- ✅ All RLS policies
- ✅ All indexes
- ✅ Storage bucket

**After running the schema, your dashboard will work!**
